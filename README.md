# Covenant Spells

This is a very simple WoW AddOn that automatically creates/edits two macros everytime you swap covenants, one for the covenant signature spell and another for the covenant class spells. It's an alternative to the big generic macros.

## Usage

After installing the addon and `/reload`ing or swapping covenants you can use the `CS_GENERIC` and `CS_SPECIFIC` macros (type `/m` to enter macro menu, `CS_GENERIC` will be on the general tab and `CS_SPECIFIC` on player tab). You can then put them in your bar and assign a keybind, they will automatically update whenever you swap covenants.

> Note for kyrian: the generic macro updates do use Phial of Serenity, you'll have to get Summon Steward from your spellbook as usual
